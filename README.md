## Getting started
**1. Add this repository to your AOSP build root's `vendor/lawnchair`**

**2. Import vendor/lawnchair/lawnchair.mk**

In case of Paranoid Android, this can be done by appending the following at `vendor/pa/config/common.mk`:

`$(call inherit-product-if-exists, vendor/lawnchair/lawnchair.mk)`

**3. Remove existing launcher from the build**

`ParanoidQuickStep`, `Launcher3QuickStep`, `PixelLauncher` and `TrebuchetQuickStep` packages are overriden from `priv-app/Lawnchair/Android.mk`.

If your existing launcher uses a different name, either remove it from the build manually or post a pull-request.

**4. Build Android**
